	abstract = {Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word. Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there are pitfalls to using automated methods—they are no substitute for careful thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must contribute new methods and new methods of validation.},

	shorttitle = {{koRpus}},
	url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=koRpus},
	abstract = {A set of tools to analyze texts. Includes, amongst others, functions for automatic language detection, hyphenation, several indices of lexical diversity (e.g., type token ratio, HD-D/vocd-D, MTLD) and readability (e.g., Flesch, SMOG, LIX, Dale-Chall). Basic import functions for language corpora are also provided, to enable frequency analyses (supports Celex and Leipzig Corpora Collection file formats) and measures like tf-idf. Note: For full functionality a local installation of TreeTagger is recommended. It is also recommended to not load this package directly, but by loading one of the available language support packages from the 'l10n' repository {\textless}https://undocumeantit.github.io/repos/l10n{\textgreater}. 'koRpus' also includes a plugin for the R GUI and IDE RKWard, providing graphical dialogs for its basic features. The respective R package 'rkward' cannot be installed directly from a repository, as it is a part of RKWard. To make full use of this feature, please install RKWard from {\textless}https://rkward.kde.org{\textgreater} (plugins are detected automatically). Due to some restrictions on CRAN, the full package sources are only available from the project homepage. To ask for help, report bugs, request features, or discuss the development of the package, please subscribe to the koRpus-dev mailing list ({\textless}http://korpusml.reaktanz.de{\textgreater}).},
